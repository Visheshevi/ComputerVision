This Repository contains some of the techniques used in Computer Vision. These all files are a part of the homework assignments given to me in the ECE 415 class at UIC.

No existing libraries were used to complete the assignments. Every code is written from scratch.

The Homework 2 folder contains the basics of image analysis like Thresholding, Histogram equalization, Gamma Correction and contrast stretching.
